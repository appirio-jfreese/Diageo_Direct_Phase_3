                <strong>Will I have to enter my user name and password every time I log in?</strong>
                <p>
                    For security purposes, external guests will indeed have to enter in user name and password upon each visit.  Internal DIAGEO teams will not.  It is recommended that you keep your user name and password in a safe location.  However all passwords all 'single sign on' enabled - meaning you will no longer need additional passwords for any affiliated DIAGEO web sites.
                </p>

                <strong>What if I forget my username and or password?</strong>
                <p>
                    Upon arriving at the site entry page - simply click on the link stating ‘<strong>forgot user name or password</strong>’.  Located on the bottom right corner of the red box.
                    <br>
                    A new temporary password and/or your username will be emailed to you  immediately.  Note:  If by chance you do not receive right away, please check your 'Junk Email' folder to be sure the automated response did not inadvertantly land in your junk email folder.
                    <br>
                    As alway, please document your new password in a safe area.

                <p>
                    If you have internet access and your user name/password – you can access DIAGEO DIRECT.

                <strong>What is the optimal internet browser that DIAGEO DIRECT operates on?</strong>
                <p>
                    Google Chrome is the best browser to launch when accessing DIAGEO DIRECT. Note:  Internet Explorer 7, Safari, etc will work, however, Google Chrome is the optimal browser to utilize.  Don’t have GOOGLE Chrome, just visit <A href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> chrome and follow download instructions for free.

                <strong>What is Diageo Direct?</strong>
                <p>
                    Diageo Direct is an on-line information sharing portal providing selling and marketing information to internal Diageo employees as well as distributors and brokers.

                <strong>How do I share a file?</strong>
                <p>
                    To share a file hover over the image until you see icons for download (down arrow), share (envelope) or add (plus sign).  When you select the envelope for share, you will get a pop up box to enter an email.  Fill out the person’s email that you would like to send to and type a message if desired.  That file will become a link for the recipient to download so file size is never an issue.

                <strong>How do I share a multiple files?</strong>
                <p>
                    To share more than one file, there is download/share multiple files option on the top right of the screen.  Click on that and you can then select whichever files you would like to share or download.

                <strong>What do I use the basket for?</strong>
                <p>
                    The basket feature was put in place to assist in collections of multiple files.  For example if you are collecting various documents throughout different locations on the site, you can add each to the basket.  Once you have finished your collection, you can then download all of the files at one time to your computer or share them via email to someone else.  The basket items never expire.

                <p>
                    The calendar in the Monthly Execution Plan calendar showcases only what is on the Diageo National Execution Plan.  The calendar in the Innovation/Sustainovation sections showcases the National Execution Plan as well as the Catalyst information and local launches.

                <p>
                    No, these programs are the same you will just find more selling materials to support the program from a multicultural perspective.

                <strong>What is the Planning section used for?</strong>
                <p>
                    The Planning section is for Diageo internal only.  The information housed there should be shared externally sparingly at the Marketing team’s discretion.

                <p>
                    Distributors and brokers have a link to DWS Academies in place of the Planning tile.

                <strong>What is the Collaboration section used for?</strong>
                <p>
                    The Collaboration section is a secure area of the site used to relay information between internal sales/marketing/finance and their respective distributors and brokers.

                <strong>Who has access to the Collaboration section?</strong>
                <p>
                    All internal Diageo employees have access to this section for best practice sharing.  Subsequently each distributor/broker only has access to their own section.

                <strong>How do I use the filters?</strong>
                <p>
                    The filters are an excellent way to narrow down specific search criteria.  For example, if you want to see all program selling decks for the month of December, you can drill down to only those files in the Selling Materials section by going into the Quarterly Selling Materials/Program Selling Materials and select your time period.  Once you have selected your time period, expand the Selling Materials filter directly underneath and choose Selling Deck.  Once your search results are returned, you will then have the option to download or share all or multiple files.

                <strong>What if I can’t find what I’m looking for?</strong>
                <p>
                    You can use the search feature located at the top right hand section indicated by a little magnifying glass.  The more specific your search is the better the results will be, for example if you only search for a brand name, you will likely get a massive return of files.  The files are returned by the section they reside in.  If you still don’t see it, choose the “Show All” button.
